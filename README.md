This is a **Quiz Game** application built using **Tkinter**, Pythonâ€™s GUI library. The game presents multiple-choice questions related to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and evaluates the user's performance.  

### **How It Works:**
1. The game window is created with a **title** and dimensions.
2. A **list of AI-related questions** and their respective **multiple-choice options** (including the correct answer) is stored in a list.
3. The **GUI layout** includes:
   - A question label.
   - Four radio buttons for answer choices.
   - A "Next" button to proceed to the next question.
4. When a user selects an answer:
   - The program checks if it is correct.
   - The total correct answers are tracked.
   - The answer choices are disabled to prevent multiple selections.
5. After answering all questions:
   - The user sees their **score**.
   - The **background color** changes to **green** (if the score is good) or **red** (if the score is low).
   - The user is given an option to **restart the quiz**.

The game dynamically updates questions and options, making it an interactive and engaging way to test AI knowledge. ðŸš€
